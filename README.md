# FNF Night Funkin Mod Manager

## Building and browsing code
This app is made in C# WPF.
I'm using the latest version of Visual Studio 2022.
### Building
First, download Visual Studio Downloader [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16) and open up the installer.
Install Visual Studio Community 2022 and select the .NET package and download [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer) here.
When it's done downloading, (IT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME!!!) open Visual and clone this repo. Open the root directory and all the files should be there!
### Browsing
I've half-heartedly tried to optimize this repo and I'm actually very proud of it.
Click on Scripts if you want to see the scripts and Windows for the actual UI.


## Errors n' Shit
If anything happens, FNF Night Mod Manager will automatically report it. You can click ERROR.txt and the ENTIRE dump will be dumped here.
Attach ERROR.txt into an issue and I will get on it.

## Roadmap
This is still in HEAVY development, so there will be a LOT of bugs in this app.
If you encounter an error PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE I BEG OF YOU, make an issue. (I know you won't).
This helps me make a lot more bug fixes and helps this entire project.

FileDaddy is better. (for skins heheheh)
