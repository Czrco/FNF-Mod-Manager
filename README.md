# FNF Night Funkin Mod Manager

## Let's talk about the code optimizability.
Devs. I wanna say something.
I'm SHIT at coding, ok? /pc I hope in the future that I could optimize my code, but I really can't, I have to admit.

This repository is kinda hard to navigate. Going onto details and how to build!

## Building and browsing code
This app is made in C# Windows Forms.
I'm using the latest version of Visual Studio 2019.
### Building
First, download Visual Studio Downloader [here](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/thank-you-downloading-visual-studio/?sku=Community&rel=16) and open up the installer.
Install Visual Studio Community 2019 and select the .NET package and download [.NET](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/thank-you/net48-web-installer) here.
When it's done downloading, (IT WILL TAKE A LONG TIME!!!) open Visual and clone this repo. Open the root directory and all the files should be there!
### Browsing
Just click a form and it'll open by itself. That's it!

## Errors n' Shit
If anything happens, FNF Night Mod Manager will automatically report it. You can click ERROR.txt and the ENTIRE dump will be dumped here.
Attach ERROR.txt into an issue and I will get on it.

## Roadmap
This is still in HEAVY development (as suggested in the logo), so there will be a LOT of bugs in this app.
If you encounter an error (I know you won't) PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE I BEG OF YOU, make an issue. PLEASE!!!!
ðŸ¥º This helps me make a lot more bug fixes and helps this entire project.

FileDaddy is better.

## Final notes and feature requests
If you're a C# coder, if you want to make a request, you could add code snippets in so I could get an idea on how to code it.
I'm amatuer.
If you're not, just try to make the request in full detail.
I want this project to take off, but I really don't think it would.
Bye!
